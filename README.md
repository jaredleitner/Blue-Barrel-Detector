# UCSD-ECE276A-Sensing-Estimation-in-Robotics

blue_detector.py

Contains my implementation for segmenting the images and determining the bbox coordinates. The parameters of the model are initialized to the values obtained during training, which are found in the following python notebook.

blue_barrel_parameter_estimation.ipynb

This notebook contains all the steps taken to obtain the model parameters, along with code for testing the accuracy on the validation set images. A multivariate Gaussian function is also implemented.
